## Next Steps

Future enhancements would include two-factor authentication (2FA), so that we could integrate an additional layer of security. Users could receive a verification code via SMS, email. Another enhancement would be a password strength indicator to guide users when creating or updating passwords, ensuring they choose strong and secure passwords. As well as a search and filter option for the index page.
